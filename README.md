1. **Navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd inventory-management-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash

##  Usage Guide

### Dashboard
- **Overview**: Key metrics including total products, suppliers, inventory value
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Products below reorder level
- **Pending Orders**: Orders awaiting completion
- **Recent Activity**: Latest order history

### Products Management
- **List View**: Browse all products with stock status
- **Create**: Add new products with detailed information
- **Details**: View product history and related orders
- **Edit**: Update product information
- **Delete**: Remove products (with confirmation)

### Suppliers Management
- **List View**: Browse all suppliers
- **Create**: Add new suppliers with contact information
- **Edit**: Update supplier details
- **Delete**: Remove suppliers (with confirmation)

### Order Tracking
- **List View**: Track all orders with filtering by type and status
- **Create**: Create new stock inflow/outflow orders
- **Filter**: Filter by order type (In/Out) and status (Pending/Completed/Cancelled)
- **Statistics**: View total inflow/outflow and pending orders

##  Key Components & Services

### Services (Dependency Injection Pattern)

All services implement CRUD operations and use RxJS Observables for reactive data management.

**ProductService**: Manages product data with low-stock filtering  
**SupplierService**: Handles supplier information and contacts  
**OrderService**: Tracks inventory movements with status management  

### Data Models

Three main domain models with interfaces and implementation classes:

**Product**: Name, price, quantity, reorder level, supplier reference  
**Supplier**: Company info, contact person, email, phone  
**Order**: Product reference, quantity, type (IN/OUT), status, date  

##  Data Flow Architecture

```
User Interaction → Component → Service (Observable) → HTTP/Mock API
                                      ↓
                           BehaviorSubject (State)
                                      ↓
                           Template (Async Pipe)
                                      ↓
                                 UI Display
```

##  Routing Configuration

- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard with key metrics
- `/products` - Product listing and management
- `/products/:id` - Individual product details
- `/suppliers` - Supplier management
- `/orders` - Order tracking and management

##  Forms Implementation

### Reactive Forms
- **Products**: FormBuilder with custom validators
- **Orders**: Type-safe form control with error handling
- Programmatic form building and validation

### Template-Driven Forms
- **Suppliers**: ngModel two-way binding
- Simple form handling with minimal code
- Good for straightforward data entry

##  API & Mock Data

The system uses intelligent mock data fallback:

```
HTTP Request Attempt → Success: Use API → Display Data
                   ↓
                 Failure: Use Mock Data
                   ↓
                Display Mock Data with Console Warning
```

Mock data includes sample products, suppliers, and orders for testing.

##  UI Components & Styling

- **Responsive Grid Layouts**: Adaptable to any screen size
- **Color-Coded Alerts**: Green (good), yellow (warning), red (critical)
- **Interactive Cards**: Hover effects and visual feedback
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Collapsible with icon support
- **Modal Dialogs**: Confirmation for destructive actions

##  Analytics & Metrics

Dashboard displays:
- Total inventory value calculation
- Stock status distribution
- Order volume statistics
- Supplier performance metrics
- Low-stock inventory alerts

**Project Version**: 1.0.0  
**Status**: Complete - All objectives achieved  
**Last Updated**: January 2024  
**Built with**: Angular 21 | TypeScript 5.9 | RxJS 7.8

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
